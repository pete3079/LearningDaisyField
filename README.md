# LearningDaisyField
I'm working through the different features of the daisy field

I am working through the examples and getting stuff working - this code is a mash up of the electro-smith oscillator/midi/keyboard examples.

It's nothing special but it does show how to write to the display and modify voices and the ADSR settings on the fly.
